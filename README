=================================

Group Info:
------------
+   Gharat Apurva (BE Comps)
+   Kulkarni Jyoti (BE Comps)
+   Patil SUpriya (BE Comps)


Project Description
-------------------

Our aim is to create an exciting game for all age groups. To achieve the aim, our objective is to study the Embedded Systems first and 
with that working of sensors, microcontrollers, MATLAB, and image processing.

Marble Maze is a board puzzle where the goal is to make a marble traverse through a maze from start to the end point. 
This project aims at robotic control for traversing of marble from a defined starting point to the ending point. 
This can be achieved using:  
1.Image Processing System (Computer Controlled) or 
2.Accelerometer (Person Controlled)


Technologies Used
-------------------

+   Embedded C
+   MATLAB
+   AVR Studio
+   Specialized Hardware


Installation Instructions
================

+ Install WINAVR
+ Install AVR Studio
+ Install MATLAB
